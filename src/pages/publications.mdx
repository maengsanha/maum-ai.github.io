            description="However, they often suffer from audible artifacts such as tonal artifacts in their generated results. Therefore, we propose JenGAN, a new training strategy that involves stacking shifted low-pass filters to ensure the shift-equivariant property. This method helps prevent aliasing and reduce artifacts while preserving the model structure used during inference. In our experimental evaluation, JenGAN consistently enhances the performance of vocoder models, yielding significantly superior scores across the majority of evaluation metrics."/>

For the language model, we adopt a dual-channel architecture to incorporate both types of representation.

Experiments on the sSIMI metric of Zero Resource Speech Benchmark 2021 and Fluent Speech Command dataset show our framework learns semantics better than models trained with only one type of representation."/>

Based on VITS, PITS incorporates the Yingram encoder, the Yingram decoder, and adversarial training of pitch-shifted synthesis to achieve pitch-controllability. Experiments demonstrate that PITS generates high-quality speech that is indistinguishable from ground truth speech and has high pitch-controllability without quality degradation."/>

            description="To deal with this problem, this paper presents E3-VITS, an end-to-end emotional TTS model that addresses the limitations of existing models. E3-VITS synthesizes high-quality speeches for multi-speaker conditions, supports both reference speech and textual description-based emotional speech synthesis, and enables cross-speaker emotion transfer with a disjoint dataset. To implement E3-VITS, we propose batch-permuted style perturbation, which generates audio samples with unpaired emotion to increase the quality of cross-speaker emotion transfer. Results show that E3-VITS outperforms the baseline model in terms of naturalness, speaker and emotion similarity, and inference speed."/>

            description="Previous generative adversarial network (GAN)-based neural vocoders are trained to reconstruct the exact ground truth waveform from the paired mel-spectrogram and do not consider the one-to-many relationship of speech synthesis. This conventional training causes overfitting for both the discriminators and the generator, leading to the periodicity artifacts in the generated audio signal. In this work, we present PhaseAug, the first differentiable augmentation for speech synthesis that rotates the phase of each frequency bin to simulate one-to-many mapping. With our proposed method, we outperform baselines without any architecture modification. Code and audio samples will be available at https://github.com/maum-ai/phaseaug."/>

            description="By the difficulty of obtaining multilingual corpus for given speaker, training multilingual TTS model with monolingual corpora is unavoidable. We introduce speaker regularization loss that improves speech naturalness during cross-lingual synthesis as well as domain adversarial training, which is applied in other multilingual TTS models. Furthermore, by adding speaker regularization loss, replacing speaker embedding with zero vector in duration predictor stabilizes cross-lingual inference. With this replacement, our model generates speeches with moderate rhythm regardless of source speaker in cross-lingual synthesis. In MOS evaluation, SANE-TTS achieves naturalness score above 3.80 both in cross-lingual and intralingual synthesis, where the ground truth score is 3.99. Also, SANE-TTS maintains speaker similarity close to that of ground truth even in cross-lingual inference. Audio samples are available on our web page."/>

            description="We introduce NU-Wave 2, a diffusion model for neural audio upsampling that enables the generation of 48 kHz audio signals from inputs of various sampling rates with a single model. Based on the architecture of NU-Wave, NU-Wave 2 uses short-time Fourier convolution (STFC) to generate harmonics to resolve the main failure modes of NU-Wave, and incorporates bandwidth spectral feature transform (BSFT) to condition the bandwidths of inputs in the frequency domain. We experimentally demonstrate that NU-Wave 2 produces high-resolution audio regardless of the sampling rate of input while requiring fewer parameters than other models."/>

To solve the cost problem, recent studies proposed language model based zero-shot semantic segmentation (L-ZSSS) approaches. In this paper, we address L-ZSSS has a limitation in generalization which is a virtue of zero-shot learning. Tackling the limitation, we propose a language-model-free zero-shot semantic segmentation framework, Spatial and Multi-scale aware Visual Class Embedding Network (SM-VCENet). Furthermore, leveraging vision-oriented class embedding SM-VCENet enriches visual information of the class embedding by multi-scale attention and spatial attention. We also propose a novel benchmark (PASCAL2COCO) for zero-shot semantic segmentation, which provides generalization evaluation by domain adaptation and contains visually challenging samples. In experiments, our SM-VCENet outperforms zero-shot semantic segmentation state-of-the-art by a significant margin in both PASCAL-5i and PASCAL2COCO benchmarks."/>

            description="In our paper, we explain how a transformer can generate high-quality images, overcoming the disadvantage that convolution operations are difficult to capture global features in an image. Furthermore, we change the demodulation of StyleGAN2 and modify the existing transformer structure (e.g., residual connection, layer normalization) to create a strong style-based generator with a convolution-free structure. We also make Styleformer lighter by applying Linformer, enabling Styleformer to generate higher resolution images and result in improvements in terms of speed and memory. We experiment with the low-resolution image dataset such as CIFAR-10, as well as the high-resolution image dataset like LSUN-church. Styleformer records FID 2.82 and IS 9.94 on CIFAR-10, a benchmark dataset, which is comparable performance to the current state-of-the-art and outperforms all GAN-based generative models, including StyleGAN2-ADA with fewer parameters on the unconditional setting.
